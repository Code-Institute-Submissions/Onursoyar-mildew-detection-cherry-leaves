********************
## Introduction
********************


 The customer working for a company in the agricultural sector  is in need and looking for a more efficient and simple method to sort out and process if their crops have been infected with Mildew or not. The active method that they are using is to manually go through and inspect the cherry leaves on their site. This method is both costly and consumes a huge amount of time.
 The purpose of this project will be to simplify their work through creating a predictive analysis machine learning tool which will be able to inspect and assess the leaf pictures uploaded within a very short amount of time and confirm whether it is infected or healthy. 



********************
## Business Requirements
********************

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute.  The company has thousands of cherry trees, located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.


1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.

2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

********************
## The Dataset
********************
* The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. We created then a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.

* The dataset contains more than 4 thousand images taken from client's crop fields. The images show cherry leaves that are healthy and cherry leaves that contain powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. The cherry plantation crop is one of their finest products in the portfolio and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a product of compromised quality.

********************
## Hypothesis and Validation
********************

*  The infected cherry leaves with powdery mildew have white streaks on surface. 

* The infected cherry leaves with powdery mildew have white streaks on surface which makes them visually different than of the healthy cherry leaves.

* The developed ML image visualizer will be able to divide and differentiate a healthy cherry leaf and an infected one.

* The ML image visualizer can help quickly and easily differentiate between images, which can save  time and money during inspections.

* The image visualizer has an accuracy rate of 97% which makes it fast, efficient and simple.


********************
## ML Tasks and Data visualizations Rationale
********************

* Business Requirement 1: The company is wants to conduct a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from an infected one'

   * It will display the "mean" and "standard deviation" images for healthy and infected leaves.
   * It will display the difference between an average leaf with powdery mildew and an average healthy cherry leaf.
   * It will display a image montage for either healthy or diseased leaves.

* Business Requirement 2: The client is interested to predict if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

   * It will need to predict if a given sample is diseased with powdery mildew or not.
   * Build a binary classifier and generate reports

********************
## ML Business Case
********************

* The idea of the business is to create a study to visually differentiate cherry leaves between healthy and diseased with powdery mildew to a degree of 97% accuracy.

* The ideal outcome is to provide the business a reliable and high accuracy in predicting healthy or diseased cherry crop by using sample leaves.

* The output is reflected in a dashboard using streamlit and the team working in the business can easily upload images of a sample cherry leaf. It reduces the manual processes around predicting powdery mildew in the plantation.

* The data analysis method can be used to visually inspect and differentiate these images of the leaves in order sort if the image contains a healthy or infected leaf.


********************
## Dashboard Design
********************
#### The project dashboard was created using the Streamlit. The menu is located on the left side with a responsive design. The menu is as follows:

* Quick Project Summary
* Cherry Leaves Visualizer
* Mildew Detection
* Project Hypothesis
* ML Performance Metrics
********************

********************
### Project Summary
********************
On the summary page, general information, project dataset and business requirements can be found. This page provides a short summary on the project, it's purpose and use. A link to this readme file has also been given if the visitor wants a more detailed summary.

********************
### Cherry Leaf Visualizer
********************
This section is based on the first business requirement. It is provided with three seperate checkboxes as seen on the image below. As these checkboxes are clicked more information of the specific parts will be provided under. The last checkbox creates an image montage based on two categories, healthy and powdery mildew. Once a label is selected it will automatically create a montage based on the selected label.

********************
### Mildew Detection
********************
The user can easily upload an image or images whether healthy or infected on this section of the menu using the file uploader. The images will be then analysed and assessed to predict if the provided leaf image is healthy or not. A downloadable report with a table will also be created so that the user can download the report on the analysed images.

## Deployment
********************


### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://mildew-detection-leaves.herokuapp.com/
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
